Kindof stupid to write this out here, totally out of context...

The short answer to the question posed for problem 9-3 will be either 1. we might want
to consume the data differently, possibly 2. we might want to be sure not to clobber
any variable assignments we've made in the program which accesses the data.

3. *per the book* (kindof plugs into my reason 1) the file may be large enough that
we wouldnt want to load all the records into RAM.
